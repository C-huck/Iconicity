# Translucency vs. Transparency
This project investigates whether transparency scores correlate with translucency scores. Many ASL signs are said to be iconic with respect to their lexical meaning. The sign CAT, for instance, is signed by tracing the outline of whiskers. Non-signers will agree that the sign CAT looks like its meaning when presented with its English equivalent, but are less likely to accurately name the sign without the translation (Klima & Bellugi, DATE). We replicate this finding by asking non-signers to label verbs that vary with respect to their translucency (these measures were obtained from ASL-LEX.org). However, instead of scoring '1' HIT and '0' MISS, we use a measure of the semantic similarity (REF). Preliminary results are dichotomous, with items with low and medium translucency scores having very low transparency scores, and items with high translucency scores having high transparency scores.
